# My first website

Seriously my first ever real website. Made more than 2 decades ago for a school musical. I found it while cleaning some digital junk. I made the 3d text and "watch" with 3D Studio Max and photoshopped it with Painshop Pro.

The frameset and inline styling was normal/hip?!? in that period. And I'm quite supprised that the website works as is. It's a testament to the backward compatability of the web. I did not change anything, the website is as it was published in 2001.
